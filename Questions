    What is an object?
    
    An object contains data. For example, you can organize the variables for a single ellipse in once place. 
    var circle = {
      x : 20
      y : 20
      diameter : 10
      }
    function draw () { 
    ellipse (circle.x, circle.y, circle.diameter, circle.diameter)
    }
    How do you access a property of an object?
    
    To access the information inside an object, you would go to where the variable is defined. 
    
    What is the index of the first item in an array?
    
    The first item in an array is index 0 (you begin counting at 0).
    
    What syntax can you use to get the third item in an array?
    
    var nums = [30,50,70,40]
    
    nums[2] 
    
    How do you use a variable and a loop to get every item in an array?
    
    function draw () {
    for (var i = 0, i < 4, i++)
   
    ellipse (i*100+100,100, nums[i], nums[i]
    }
